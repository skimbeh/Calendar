# Calendar
This is a calendar for my website, that people use to select a date. 

This date should be a week (7 days exact) from now. So the disabled date should be upped by 7. 

Also the output 'date selected' has to be edited from this long string to just the date itself. 

Could anyone help me please, thanks in advance :)
